# Criando um Pacote de Processamento de Imagens com Python

## edge_detector

Software that implements edge detection in a simple and modular way, demonstrating how to use OpenCV in Python.

An edge detection project, like the one we developed, has various objectives and practical applications in the field of image processing and computer vision. Here are some of the main objectives and uses:

**Image Analysis**

Feature Extraction: Edge detection is a fundamental technique for extracting important features from an image, such as contours and shapes. This is crucial for image analysis in various applications.

**Pre-processing for Other Algorithms**

Preparation for Segmentation: Edge detection can be used as a pre-processing step for image segmentation, where the image is divided into meaningful regions.
Facilitating Pattern Recognition: Edge detection can help pattern recognition algorithms identify objects or shapes within an image.

**Applications in Computer Vision**

Object Detection: Used in computer vision systems to identify and locate objects in images or videos.
Robotic Navigation: In robotics, edge detection helps robots understand their surroundings, allowing them to navigate effectively.

**Image Enhancement**

Visual Enhancement: It can be used to improve image visualization by highlighting contours and structures that may not be visible in the original image.

**Education and Research**

Learning: Projects like this are often used in educational settings to teach concepts of image processing and programming.
Experiments: Researchers can use edge detection as a basis for developing new algorithms or testing image processing techniques.

**Industry**

Quality Inspection: In manufacturing, edge detection is used to inspect products and ensure they meet quality standards.
Medical Image Analysis: In medical imaging, it can help in identifying contours of organs or tumors.
